#### Simulation of a participatory budgeting voting system.

We will simulate a participatory budgeting scenario, in which multiple agents vote on various issues. For each agent we will have different individual priorities. Also, one more thing that we will simulate is the costs of implementing each project, in order to find a common plan that is not only socially supported, but also financially feasible.
