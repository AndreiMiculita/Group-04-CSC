#### Simulation of a participatory budgeting voting system.

We will simulate a participatory budgeting scenario, in which multiple agents vote on various issues. For each agent we will have different individual priorities. Also, one more thing that we will simulate is the costs of implementing each project, in order to find a common plan that is not only socially supported, but also financially feasible.

TODO:
* modify the functions to add cost for each project
* define some of the axioms that we want to respect
* simulate the participants and ballot
  * generate a ballot of cardinal votes for each option
  * try an average function at first
  * also try to give more weight to some voters
